ðŸ”’ Firewall Basics

ðŸ”¹ What is a Firewall?

A firewall is a security system (software, hardware, or both) that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.
It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks (like the internet).

ðŸ”¹ Types of Firewalls

1.Packet-Filtering Firewall
  * Examines packets (source/destination IP, port, protocol).
  * Simple, fast, but limited â€” doesnâ€™t look inside traffic.

2.Stateful Inspection Firewall
  * Tracks active connections and allows only valid return traffic.
  * More secure than packet filtering.

3.Application-Level Firewall (Proxy)
  * Filters traffic for specific applications (HTTP, FTP, DNS).
  * Can inspect content, not just headers.

4.Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
  * Includes deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, malware detection.
  * Often used in enterprises.

ðŸ”¹ Firewall Functions

  * Allow or block traffic based on rules (IP, port, protocol, program).
  * Protect against unauthorized access from external sources.
  * Limit exposure of vulnerable services (e.g., Telnet, FTP).
  * Segmentation of networks (internal vs. external).
  * Logging & monitoring of network activity.

ðŸ”¹ Common Firewall Rules

  * Allow SSH (22) â€“ so admins can connect.
  * Block Telnet (23) â€“ insecure, often disabled.
  * Allow HTTP/HTTPS (80/443) â€“ for web services.
  * Restrict access by IP range â€“ e.g., only allow internal LAN.

ðŸ”¹ Windows Firewall

  1. Open firewall configuration tool

   Press Win + R, type:

          wf.msc

   This opens Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.

  2. List current firewall rules

   In the left pane, click Inbound Rules â†’ youâ€™ll see all rules.

  3. Add a rule to block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet)

   Click Inbound Rules â†’ New Rule â†’ Port
   Select TCP, enter 23, choose Block the connection, apply to all profiles.
   Name it: Block Telnet.

  4. Test the rule

   Open PowerShell:
      
      Test-NetConnection -Port 23 localhost
      
   It should show TcpTestSucceeded: False.

  5. Allow SSH (if using OpenSSH on Windows or Linux target)

   In Inbound Rules â†’ New Rule â†’ Port â†’ TCP â†’ 22
   Choose Allow the connection.

  6. Remove the test block rule

   Find Block Telnet in the list â†’ Right-click â†’ Delete.

Windows Firewall filters traffic by applying rule sets (allow/block) based on programs, ports, protocols, or IPs. Rules determine whether inbound/outbound         packets are passed or dropped.
